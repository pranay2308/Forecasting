# 📊 DataPioneers: Forecasting Project

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of a **Data Science course** and focuses on **forecasting future trends** using historical data.  
The goal is to build an end-to-end data science pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — and generate reliable forecasts that can guide decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the project
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing**  
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and insights  
- Engineer features to improve model performance  
- Apply **forecasting techniques** (time series models and machine learning models)  
- Compare models using evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, etc.)  
- Generate and visualize forecasts for future values  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries & Tools**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → Data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` → Machine learning models & evaluation  
  - `statsmodels`, `prophet` → Time-series forecasting  
  - `jupyter` → Interactive notebook environment
